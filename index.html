					<h1>The Process</h1>
					<p>We've created a system that helps you translate business needs and abstract design ideas into a tangible digital product. You are an expert on your business, we are experts on the web. The only way to build an amazing product that reflects your business and our skills is to work colaboratively with our clients.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="slide" id="slide-two">
					<h1>Determine Your Needs</h1>
					<p>The first thing we want to know is "Will a new website help your business reach it's potential?". Sometimes your business goals can be reached more effectively by other means. We are your advocate for the digital space. As such, we will be honest about whether our web services are really required for your business' needs. <b>YOUR</b> needs drive <b>YOUR</b> project. We will analyze, consult, plan and build with a focus on delivering real value to your company.</p>

					<h1>Proposal</h1>
					<p>explain the proposl process. include RFP template. introduce what our proposal proposes.</p>

				<div class="slide" id="slide-four">
					<h1>Brand Identity</h1>
					<p>We have our style, but we're versatile enough to ignore it and make yours come to life. We aim to build websites that reflect the vibe your company has. We work to fully understand your brand and style. This allows our designers to deliver concepts that are uniquely yours and capture your vision.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="slide" id="slide-five">
					<h1>Design Cues</h1>
					<p>Before we even begin with wireframes or composites, we start with design cues. A tangible custom built stylescape that reflects the look and feel of the final site. This will help define attributes such as color palette, typography, and general design. Because it's a physical reflection of your website's final design, it's easy for you point and say "I like 'this', I don't like 'that'".</p>
